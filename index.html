            <p class="ppp">Brian Nickila lives in St. Paul, Minnesota with his wife and two children. He works as a live nursery specialist in a retail garden center where he takes care of ordering and maintaining plants throughout the gardening season and cuts Christmas trees during the Holidays. He never really wanted to do that, he just did it for a while and became complacent.</p>

            <p>Brian received a bachelor of fine arts degree at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point where he honed his skills as a painter, animator, illustrator and photographer. One of his most recent photographic accomplishments was the self-portrait seen above, taken with his telephone in the bathroom in such a way that he didn’t want the viewer to know that he was the type of guy that would take a picture of himself in the bathroom. But he most certainly is! He still works retail despite this skill.</p>
            
            <p>Brian is also building a tiny house in his backyard. When people ask him "hey Brian, why are you building that?" he just kinda shrugs, usually. He’s not sure why he’s building it. It’s just something he wants to do, he supposes. He may someday put it on a quiet piece of land by a lake or a stream in the middle of the woods and build one for each member of his family and space them a nice distance from one another. Maybe a half-day walk or so.</p>
            
            <p class="pp">Currently, Brian is taking a coding course at the University of Minnesota where he hopes to acquire the skills that would allow him to move on to a career he will love and make tons of cash to buy some land in the middle of the woods and enough materials for three more tiny houses.</p>
